# Shell Scripting Collection

A collection of shell scripts for automating various Linux system tasks. Each folder contains a standalone script with its own README and usage instructions.

## Contents

- `get-python/` — Install any Python version from source
- `auto-kinit/` — Automating kerberos kinit process
- `docker-limit/` — Simple tools to limit docker container resources

Each script is built to be portable, readable, and (mostly) POSIX compliant. Perfect for system admins, learners, or CLI fans.

## Why?

I wanted to sharpen my Bash skills, automate boring stuff, and document the process. Sharing here in case it's useful to others too.
